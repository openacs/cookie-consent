Integration of the Cookie Consent Library into OpenACS

The Cookie Consent Library is a free and open sourced library for for
alerting users about the use of cookies on a website.  It is designed
to help you comply with the hideous EU Cookie Law and can be used
relatively painless.

This package integrates the Consent Plugin with OpenACS,
in particular with OpenACS subsites.

So far, this package supports on the "inform" type of cookie consent
policies. When the "opt-out" or "opt-in" variants of the policies
should really include all types of cookies (even session-cookies)
the user would not be able to login to the site. However,
most countries stick for now to the "inform" policy, and the
detailed regulation are still in flux.

FEATURES:

- Configure the appearance of the cookie consent widget via
  the following parameter (on acs-subsite):
     CookieConsentEnabled    0|1
     CookieConsentPosition   bottom|top|pushdown|left|right
     CookieConsentLayout     block|classic|edgeless|wire
     CookieConsentPalette    oacs|honeybee|mono|neon|corporate

     CookieConsentDefaultPalette

- Usage from CDN (out-of-the box) or from
  a local copy (download your local copy via
  "Site-Wide Admin" link in /acs-admin/)

- Support for host-node-mapped subsites
- Internationalized with OpenACS message keys


INSTALLATON:
 1) Install this package
    via the OpenACS Package Manager

 2) Add this package to the templating system

    - OpenACS 5.10.0d2 or newer:
      The cookie consent widgets uses the "subsite::page_plugin"
      callback, so no changes on templates are necessary.

      However, make sure, you update also acs-bootstrap-installer to
      5.10.0d2 or newer to obtain the updated blank-master

    - OpenACS 5.9.1:
      Add to the top of your blank-master.tcl the following snippet:

      ================================================================
      if {[info commands ::cookieconsent::initialize_widget] ne ""} {
	  ::cookieconsent::initialize_widget
      }
      ================================================================

 3) Configure in the parameters of the subsite (e.g. the main subsite)
    the section "Cookie Consent"


PREREQUIREMENTS:

The implementation uses nx from the next-scripting framework.

    https://next-scripting.org/xowiki/

which is automatically installed for XOTcl2 via
https://openacs.org/xowiki/naviserver-openacs

It works best with OpenACS 5.10.0d2 or newer, but works as well
with 5.9.1 (see INSTALLATION section above) or earlier versions
supporting Content Security Policy (CSP), and probably with  
earlier versions as well, when CSP code is commented out.
